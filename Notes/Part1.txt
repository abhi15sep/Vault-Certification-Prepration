Important Pointers for Exam part1:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Dynamic Secrets:
================
1. Dynamic secrets allow you to generate credentials on-demand dynamically and are automatically revoked after certain duration.
2. Not all secrets engine supports dynamic credentials.
3. Common supported engines: AWS, Database, Google cloud, Azure.
4. Dynamic secret does not provide any stronger cryptographic key generation.

Lease Management:
==================
1. With every dynamic secret and service type authentication token, vault creates a lease: metadata containing information such as a time duration, renewability and more.
2. Once lease is expired, Vault can automatically revoke the data, and the consumer of secret can no longer be certain that its valid.

Lease Options || Description
1. renew - This command renews the lease on a secret, extending the time it can be used before it is revoked by vault.
2. revoke - When a lease is revoked, it invalidates the secret immediately and prevents any further renewals.

Lease Renewal and Revocation:
1. vault lease renew -increment=3600 my-lease-id : Would request that the TTL of lease be adjusted to 1 hour (3600 seconds).
2. vault lease revoke my-lease-id : Revoke a specific lease.
3. vault lease revoke -prefix aws/ : Revoke all aws access keys. (Path based revoke)

Transit Secret Engine:
=======================
1. The transit secret engine handles cryptographic functions on data in-transit.
2. All plaintext data must be base64 encoded.
3. The reason for this requirement is that Vault does not require that the plain text is "text". It could be a binary file such as a PDF or image.
4. We can rotate encrytion keys at regular intervals to ensure that not all data is encrypted with just one encryption key.

Transit Secret Engine - Key version:
====================================
1. The transit engine supports versioning of keys.
2. Key versions that are earlier than a key's specified min_decryption_version gets archived, and the rest of key versions belong to the working set.
3. This leads to both performance benefit as well as security benefits.
4. By disallowing decryption of old version of keys, found ciphertext to obsolete (but sensitive) data can not be decrypted, but in an emergency the min_decryption_version can be moved back to allow for legitimate decryption.
