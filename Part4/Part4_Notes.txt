Overview of Vault for production:
=================================
Till now we have been making using vault under development mode where all data was stored under memory.
For Production, We need a better storage class to store the data.
There are multiple storage class that can be used, some of these includes:
1) Filesystem
2) S3
3) Consul
4) Databases (Mysql, dynamodb, PostgreSQL)

Steps involved to deploy vault in production:
=============================================
1. Create a configuration file. The format of the file is HCL or Json.
storage "file" {
	path = "/root/vault-data"
}

listener "tcp" {
	address = "0.0.0.0:8200"
	tls_disable = 1
}

2. Start Vault from configuration file.
> vault server -config demo.hcl

If you will try vault list /auth/token/accessors, it will fail with error "vault is sealed"

3. Initialize the vault:
This only happens once when the server is started against a new backend that has never been used with vault before. During initialization, the encryption keys are generated, unseal keys are created, and the initial root token is setup.

> vault operator init
Unseal Key 1: LKiR4yU3RJQIIQQzb/MjRh8+Q520KoTKnAN5xiEwclLH
Unseal Key 2: D0+8/fQpgEKdhlmK/U4CqWv1C9gV80OD/KF6rsVMqn+Q
Unseal Key 3: E48Lxcil0Ssy8vc6YaWX2PP0MbA876I9OES6LQ8zF0tE
Unseal Key 4: TSKBqo9ZEjasZjIMOVjYw1VIRsKCwo5qyT7ISqhRVYeV
Unseal Key 5: wjFhnE2JjEzWH1+eePNivqTmviX9HF8qPuVcJiqNp12w

Initial Root Token: s.lV7avnZvJHcLselqpClj3GHL


Make sure to store these 5 unseal keys and root token at secure place, after this you will not get this. At this stage vault is till in sealed mode, so even with root token you will not be able to perform any operation. So you have to unseal your vault now.

4. Unseal the vault:
Every initialized vault server starts in the sealed state. From the configuration, vault can access the physical storage, but it can't read any of it because it doesn't know how to decrypt it.
The process of teaching vault how to decrypt the data is known as unsealing the vault.

You need to any one of three unseal keys.

>> After restarting vault again it goes to sealed state, so need to unseal it.

Important Pointers: Iniialization state:
1. Initialization outouts two incredibly important pieces of information: The unseal keys and the initial root token.

This is the only time ever that all of these data is shown by vault, and also the only time that the unseal keys should ever be so close together.

============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Vault UI for Production:
==========================
1. Required Configuration:
listener "tcp" {
  address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable = 1
}

ui = "true"

Then restart the vault server.

============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Vault Agent:
============
For the application that needs to intract with Vault, it first needs to authenticate and then use the 	tokens for performing required tasks.
Apart from this, Application also needs to have a logic related to token renewal and others.
Instead of building custom logic in application, you can instead make use of Vault agent.

Vault agent is client daemon which automates the workflow of client login and token refresh.
> Automatically authenticates to Vault for those supported auth methods.
> Keeps token renewed (re-authenticates as needed) until the renewal is no longer allowed.
> Designed with robustness and fault tolerance.

Running Vault Agent:
===================
In order to make use of vault agent, you can run the vault binary in agent mode.
vault agent config=<config-file>

The agent configuration file must specify the auth method and sink locations where the token to be written.

When agent is started, it will attempt to acquire a vault token using the auth method specified in agent configuration file. On successful authentication, the resulting token is written to the sink locations.
Whenever current token value changes, the agent writes to the sink. 

Practical:
==========
1. First enable approle based authentication.
vault auth enable approle

2. From GUI, go and create agent-policy

path "auth/token/create" {
	capabilities: ["update"]
}

3. Once policy is available, we will create a role name would be vaultagent.
> vault write auth/approle/role/vaultagent token_policies="agent-policy"
Success! Data written to: auth/approle/role/vaultagent

4. Fetch the role-id:
> vault read auth/approle/role/vaultagent/role-id
Key        Value
---        -----
role_id    0c5f2bb1-b72b-a935-c2ba-7764147b8f65

5. Lets fetch the secret-id:
> vault write -f auth/approle/role/vaultagent/secret-id
Key                   Value
---                   -----
secret_id             4d50b65a-4edd-afba-af89-a8aff2d5a5dd
secret_id_accessor    e3ea534b-773f-eb9d-c4ff-3c0a7aa90572

6. Vault Agent Configuration File: agent.hcl

exit_after_auth = false
pid_file = "./pidfile"

auto_auth {
   method "approle" {
       mount_path = "auth/approle"
       config = {
           role_id_file_path = "/tmp/role-id"
           secret_id_file_path = "/tmp/secret-id"
           remove_secret_id_file_after_reading = false
       }
   }

   sink "file" {
       config = {
           path = "/tmp/token"
       }
   }
}

vault {
   address = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
}

7. vault agent -config=agent.hcl

8. cat /tmp/token
s.uDHxngbmGqnEALxBIpbale3T

9. Now use the token:
>vault token lookup s.uDHxngbmGqnEALxBIpbale3T

============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Vault Agent Caching:
====================
There are 2 primary functionalities related to vault agent:
1. Auto-Auth: Automatically authenticate to vault and manage the token renewal process.
2. caching: Allows client side caching of responses containing newly created tokens.

Overview of vault caching:
Allows client side caching of responses containing newly created tokens and responses containing leased secrets generated off of these newly created tokens.

Practical:
=========

1. Agent Configuration File: agent.hcl
exit_after_auth = false
pid_file = "./pidfile"

auto_auth {
   method "approle" {
       mount_path = "auth/approle"
       config = {
           role_id_file_path = "/tmp/role-id"
           secret_id_file_path = "/tmp/secret-id"
           remove_secret_id_file_after_reading = false
       }
   }

   sink "file" {
       config = {
           path = "/tmp/token"
       }
   }
}

cache {
  use_auto_auth_token = true
}

listener "tcp" {
   address = "127.0.0.1:8007"
   tls_disable = true
}


vault {
   address = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
}

2. Start vault agent:
vault agent -config=agent.hcl


3. Run vault token create command:
VAULT_TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/token) vault token create
Key                  Value
---                  -----
token                s.GtK7fbCukL5uL4VS45VPrLsH
token_accessor       QdSANFrxXY2ADadoES2Pl4tL
token_duration       768h
token_renewable      true
token_policies       ["agent-policy" "default"]
identity_policies    []
policies             ["agent-policy" "default"]

4. Till now we are directly sending request to vault server and not to vault agent. To send request to vault agent:
export VAULT_AGENT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8007"
VAULT_TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/token) vault token create
Key                  Value
---                  -----
token                s.YF7A75AlGX1ITRqn2VU0rq81
token_accessor       XhyCGeEQgYbULuLElSTDm3Yi
token_duration       768h
token_renewable      true
token_policies       ["agent-policy" "default"]
identity_policies    []
policies             ["agent-policy" "default"]

Notice in vault agent logs:
==============
2020-07-04T20:38:20.316+0100 [INFO]  cache: received request: method=POST path=/v1/auth/token/create
2020-07-04T20:38:20.316+0100 [INFO]  cache.apiproxy: forwarding request: method=POST path=/v1/auth/token/create

5. Try the command again and you will see that request is served from cache:
VAULT_TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/token) vault token create
2020-07-04T20:40:45.701+0100 [INFO]  cache: received request: method=POST path=/v1/auth/token/create

============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Shamir's Secret:
===============
The storage backend in vault is considered to be untrested. The data stored in storage backend is within the encrypted state.

When the vault is initialized it generates an encryption key which is used to protect all the data. The key is protected by a master key.

Vault uses a technique known as Shamir's secret sharing algorithm to split the master key in 5 shares, any 3 of which are required to reconstruct the master key.

Important Pointers:
1. The number of shares and the minimum threshold required can both be specified.
2. Shamir's technique can be disabled, and the master key used directly for unsealing.
3. Once vault retrieves the encryption key, it is able to decrypt the data in the storage backend, and enters the unsealed state.

Seal Stanza:
============
The seal stanza configures the seal type to use for additional data protection, such as HSM or cloud KMS solutions to encrypt and decrypt the master key.

The stanza is optional, and in the case of the master key, Vault will use the Shamir's algorithm to cryptographically split the master key if this is not configured.

seal [NAME] {
	#...
}

============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Vault Replication:
==================
A single vault cluster can impose various challanges related to high latency, connectivity failures, availability loss and others.

In performance replication, secondaries keep track of their own tokens and leases but share the underlying configuration, policies and supporting secrets (K/V values, encryption keys for transit etc.)

Disaster recovery replication: Ability to fully restore all types of data (local and the cluster data).
Secondary cluster does not handle any client request and can be promoted to be the new primary in case of disaster.

============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Audit Devices:
==============
Audit devices are components in vault that keep a detailed log of all request and response to vault.
Because every operation with vault is an API request/response, the audit log contains every authenticated interaction with Vault, including errors. 

Enabling Auditing: When a vault server is first initialized, no auditing is enabled. Audit devices must be enabled by a root user using: vault audit enable.

Practical:
==========
1. Start vault server in dev environment: vault server -dev
2. From a different screen enable vault logging.

>vault audit list
No audit devices are enabled.

> vault audit enable file file_path=vault-audit.log
Success! Enabled the file audit device at: file/

OR

vault audit enable -path="audit_path" file file_path=~/vault-audit.log
Success! Enabled the file audit device at: audit_path/


> vault audit list
Path     Type    Description
----     ----    -----------
file/    file    n/a

3. Lets do some activity.
> vault auth enable userpass
Success! Enabled userpass auth method at: userpass/

4. Where vault server is running, within that folder check vault-audit.log file.

NOTE: (https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/system/audit-hash)-In the response log, there is a filed client_token which is hashed value not the exact token.

> vault print token
s.lwqgIcs6MyuHjPtefRBKKJ3v

> curl --header "X-Vault-Token: s.lwqgIcs6MyuHjPtefRBKKJ3v" --request POST --data @audit.json http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/audit-hash/audit_path
{"hash":"hmac-sha256:b9791373454e37f1be30bce149c5469967d041e21b778b0c1417fcedb8591c71","request_id":"d726bc43-60b7-74aa-3546-d11d6207dcc4","lease_id":"","renewable":false,"lease_duration":0,"data":{"hash":"hmac-sha256:b9791373454e37f1be30bce149c5469967d041e21b778b0c1417fcedb8591c71"},"wrap_info":null,"warnings":null,"auth":null}


Important Points:
1. If there are any audit devices enabled, Vault requires that atleast one be able to persist the log before completing the vault request.
2. If you have one one audit device enabled, and its blocked (network block etc), then vault will be unresponsive. Vault will not complete any requests until audit device can write.
3. If you have more than one audit device, then vault will complete the request as long as one audit device persists the log.
